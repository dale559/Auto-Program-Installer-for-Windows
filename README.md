# AutoProgramInstaller
Windows Powershell script that Auto install programs
Make sure to type "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" into powershell beforehand to make sure it works
Run this in admin Powershell and you will get a GUI with options to install the programs.

If you have any suggestions for new programs for me to add feel free to let me know!
